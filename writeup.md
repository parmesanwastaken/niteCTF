# OSINT

## Cornfield Chase
- The image had many clues, but the most significant was the blue sign
- It had chinese written on it with some unique codes
- I reverse searched the image and turns out it is used by Taiwan power supply
- So I went to their (website)[https://data.gov.tw/en/datasets/33305] and download a csv and searched up that got
- I got some proprietary taiwan coordinates which I converted to DMS
- Then I went to that location and looked around for some time and found the exact location

## Bonsai Bankai
- The area was obviously in Japan cause of the house structures and signs with japenese around
- I looked around and thought about reverse image searching the brows house
- I found a property seller who had address attatched to this house
- This gave me the exact coords
- I went to that spot and got the flag

## The Flash
- The image burned my retina
- It barely had anything visible on it to figure out the place
- The electric pole was too generic and so where the yellow traffic signs
- Decided to reverse image search the vegetation and turns out Ooty has a similar scenary near it
- The pine forest area was the biggest hint
- I went to street view near there and realised the shape and structure of whole thing was similar
- Now the easy part was over and I spent 4-5 hours finding the exact spot
- Finally went a bit near city area and street view had this similar glare, so I followed the path till it reached near lake and pine tree forest
- After going up the hill a bit I found the exact area and got the flag
- Turns out it was just below the path I started with in ooty

## Hillbilly
- First I tried searching for trees and turns out olive trees are common around Greece, Italy and Syria area
- The best bet for me was Greece as it has lot of area with similar olive groves
- At first I thought it was near Athens and 2 cities near it, I spent around 8 hours in this area
- Then I decided to use a filter tool for google street view before 2016, as the watermark on challenge image was 2015
- Now I scanned almost 3 cities and went around and around, the mountains there did look similar and so were trees
- There was no hope though so I decided to try out my last method
- I reverse image searched the grill/barrier in challenge image with olive tree in background
- After discaridng first few searches, I found a plot seller that had pictures of similar colour scheme, trees, soil and most importantly barriers on their (website)[https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/161713154?currencyCode=GBP#/media?id=media8&ref=photoCollage&channel=OVERSEAS]
- So I decided to go there and found exactly the same mountains
- I went near it and tried to find similar view/angle
- After few minutes I found similar looking groves and barriers
- Followed it and found same background too
- Thus I got the flag

## Road Not Taken
- At first I had no clue where this could be but after searching a while I found out only Ghana has black tape in front side of car
- Then I went there and looked for like an hour but it was too huge
- Later decided to search up and found there are metas for Ghana
- I decided to follow (plonkit)[https://www.plonkit.net/ghana] and (geotips)[https://geotips.net/africa/] for this
- Decided to follow tape meta on there which marked specific roads with similar tape wearing
- Then looked around and went to south and south eastern area as they are supposed to have a bit of red soil and are lush
- Looked there for hours but roads wouldn't end
- Decided to follow compass on challenge's page and looked through all north/south looking roads
- Spent around 5 hours on this as I decided to even check western and bit of northern region for north-south leading roads
- Turns out the compass was broken
- Now it clicked to me that it is obviously not a highway as the title says road not taken
- So I decided to check more roads, now based on clear sky, sun location and tape meta
- After 5-6 more hours I was near entrance of this city where I found same van in front of me as challenge
- I followed it and finally found the flag
